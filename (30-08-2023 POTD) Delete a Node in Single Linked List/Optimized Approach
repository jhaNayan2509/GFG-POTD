JAVA Simple Approach: T.C.: O(N) S.C.:O(1)

 

1.Simply traverse the Linked List and check if head equals to null,then return null. Or if x equals to 1, 
then update head with head.next means make the next node the head of the LinkedList,because first node is deleted.Then return the head.

2.Else:

 >Declare a count variable named 'i' here and initialise with 1.

 > Declare two pointers curr and prev which will initialise with head node only, 
basically these two pointers used to keep track of previous and current element as we traverse over the linked list.

 

3.Now, simply traverse the linked list using while loop, and check if count varible i becomes equal to x or not, 
if yes then just update the previous node next reference with current node next reference , in this way current node(desired node) is deleted. So, just break the loop.

 

4.With every iteration, move prev pointer to  the current one, and curr pointer to the next one, 
increase count by 1.Go on iterating untill we meet the termination condition .i.e. curr pointer pointing to nulls or on encountering the break statement.

 

5.Return Head and Smile , because you have got the solution!!
