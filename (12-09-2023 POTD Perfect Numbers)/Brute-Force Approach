/*
Java Simple Approach:

In brute-force approach,we will simply iterate from 1 to N-1 and add every factor of N into the integer sum 
and if the sum becomes equal to N we return 1 otherwise 0.

We are running loop only till N-1 because it is given in the question that we have to consider all the factors except the number itself.

T.C.: O(N), As we are traversing through a loop of size N once.
S.C.: O(1), As we are not using any extra space.

class Solution {
    static int isPerfectNumber(long N) {
        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= N - 1; i++) {

            if (N % i == 0) {
                sum += i;
            }
        }

        if(sum==N) return 1;
        return 0;
    }
}
