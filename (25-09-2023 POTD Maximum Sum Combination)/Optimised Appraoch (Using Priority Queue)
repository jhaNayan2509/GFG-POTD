Java Simple Approach:

Basic Idea: 

The idea in this is to use a priority queue.
The idea is to start with the maximum possible sum combination, which is obtained by taking the last elements of both arrays.
Then, iteratively explore the next largest sum combinations by considering elements from either array A or B, which can be the possible candidates for maximum sum.


Steps:

1.Create an empty ArrayList called al to store the maximum combinations.

2.Sort both arr and brr arrays using the Arrays.sort() method. This step ensures that the arrays are in ascending order.

3.Create a PriorityQueue called pq to store the sums of the combinations. The PriorityQueue is used to keep track of the k largest sums.

4.Initialize a variable i with the value of n-1. This variable will be used to iterate through the arr array from the last element to the first.
Start a while loop that runs as long as i is greater than or equal to 0.

5.Inside the while loop, initialize a variable j with the value of n-1. 
This variable will be used to iterate through the brr array from the last element to the first.

6.Start another while loop that runs as long as j is greater than or equal to 0.

7.Calculate the sum of the current elements from arr and brr arrays: sum = arr[i] + brr[j].

8.Check if the size of the PriorityQueue pq is less than k. If it is, add the sum to the PriorityQueue using the pq.add() method.
If the size of the PriorityQueue pq is equal to k, compare the sum with the smallest element in the PriorityQueue using the pq.peek() method.

9.If the sum is greater than the smallest element in the PriorityQueue, remove the smallest element using the pq.poll() method 
and add the sum to the PriorityQueue using the pq.add() method.

10.If the sum is not greater than the smallest element in the PriorityQueue, break out of the inner while loop.

11.Decrement j by 1 to move to the next element in the brr array.
Decrement i by 1 to move to the next element in the arr array.

12.After both while loops have finished, iterate through the PriorityQueue pq using a while loop.
Remove each element from the PriorityQueue using the pq.poll() method and add it to the ArrayList al.

13.Sort the ArrayList al in descending order using the Collections.sort() method with the Collections.reverseOrder() comparator.
Return the ArrayList al as the result.



In summary, the code implementation finds the maximum k combinations of elements from two given arrays by sorting the arrays,
using a PriorityQueue to keep track of the k largest sums, and returning the result in descending order.



T.C.: O(NlogN), As we are soting the array whose complexity is O(NlogN) and we are also running a loop of size K and inside it we insert and
take the element out from the priority queue and set whose complexity is O(logN), so total complexity becomes O(NlogN).

S.C.: O(N), As we have use priority queue, set and an arraylist to store the answer, So total space complexity becomes O(N).
